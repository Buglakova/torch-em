# Experiments

Contains the scripts to train models with `torch_em` and perform further experiments. Most of the code here has been used to train models for [BioImage.IO](https://bioimage.io/#/).

The best entrypoints for training a model yourself are the notebooks:
- `2D-UNet-Training`: train a 2d UNet for segmentation tasks, [available on google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/torch-em/blob/main/experiments/2D-UNet-Training.ipynb).
- `3D-UNet-Training`: train a 3d UNet for segmentation tasks, [available on google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/torch-em/blob/main/experiments/3D-UNet-Training.ipynb).
